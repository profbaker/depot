<p>Stressed Out by Twenty One Pilots</p>

<p>I wish I found some better sounds no one’s ever heard, I wish I had a
better voice that sang some better words, I wish I found some chords in an
order that is new, I wish I didn&#39;t have to rhyme every time I sang,</p>

<p>I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink, But now I’m insecure
and I care what people think. My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you
think</p>

<p>Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us
to sleep but now we’re stressed out.</p>

<p>Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young, How come
I’m never able to identify where it’s coming from, I’d make a candle out of
it if I ever found it, Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I’d probably
only sell one,</p>

<p>It’d be to my brother, ‘cause we have the same nose, Same clothes homegrown
a stone’s throw from a creek we used to roam, But it would remind us of
when nothing really mattered, Out of student loans and treehouse homes we
all would take the latter.</p>

<p>My name’s ‘Blurryface’ and I care what you think</p>

<p>Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us
to sleep but now we’re stressed out.</p>

<p>We used to play pretend, give each other different names, We would build a
rocket ship and then we’d fly it far away, Used to dream of outer space but
now they’re laughing at our face, Saying, “wake up, you need to make
money.“</p>

<p>Wish we could turn back time, to the good ol’ days, When our momma sang us
to sleep but now we’re stressed out.</p>
